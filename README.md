- The "codes" folder contains all .py files used in developing the models for the predictive analysis.
- The "data" folder contains all .csv and .txt files used to train and fit the models.
- The "graph" folder contains all visualizations generated from the model results.
- All .py files can be ran if the repo is cloned; no need for any secrets/keys

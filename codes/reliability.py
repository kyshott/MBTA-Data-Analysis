"""
A few notes about this analysis; the question to be answered is regarding that of 
whether or not the time of the year can affect the reliability of an MBTA Commuter
Rail line. Specifically, this is done by using a machine learning model w/linear regression.
For higher R^2 values, the line is more affected by the month. For lower or 0 R^2 values, the
month has no effect at all. The MAE will demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions based on the
data given. This also provides insight into some patterns that riders can look out for with specific lines.
For example, the Fitchburg line seems to decline throughout the year, which can give riders insight into what months
the train will run on time. However, there is a lot of assumption to be made based off of the prediction model alone,
which is definitely a large shortcoming.
